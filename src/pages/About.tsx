            <p className="mb-4">
              Doodle Desk was founded in 2015 with a simple mission: to provide a nurturing environment where children can thrive and grow. 
              What started as a small daycare with just five children has blossomed into a respected early education center serving over 100 families in our community.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our founder, an early childhood education specialist, created Doodle Desk based on the belief that every child deserves 
              a joyful, enriching early learning experience that builds a foundation for lifelong success.
